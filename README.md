- (Project 1) : Simple Calculator :
In this assignment, I will develop a basic calculator program using Python. This project 
will reinforce fundamental programming concepts including functions, user input, 
conditional statements, and error handling. The application will run in the terminal and 
should not use any external libraries or frameworks.


- (Project 2): Number Guessing Game :
In this assignment, I will create a CLI-based Number Guessing Game using Python. The 
objective of this project is to design an interactive game where the computer selects a 
random number between 1 and 100, and the user attempts to guess it. Your program will 
need to generate a random number, handle user input, and provide feedback based on the 
user's guesses.
