- Project_1 Simple Calculator :
I will develop a basic calculator program in Python to reinforce fundamental concepts like functions, user input, conditionals, and error handling. The program will run in the terminal without using external libraries or frameworks.


- Project_2 Number Guessing Game :
I will create a CLI-based Number Guessing Game in Python where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the user guesses it. The program will handle user input and provide feedback on the guesses.
